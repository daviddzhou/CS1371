% ABCs of Surface Plotting
%
%
% Directions:
%   Follow the steps specified below and fill in the blanks to complete
%   this plotting code.

% 1. Use meshgrid() to output a "grid" of values, using the data stored in 
%    the given variables x1 and y1.
%    [A, B]


% 2. Continue using the output values above to create another output
%    that associates the x and y variables according to the equation: 
%    z = x^2 + 3y^2 + 1.
%    [C]


% 3. Create a 3x2 subplot and begin plotting at the top left corner


% 4. Use all of the previous outputs and the mesh() function to create a
%    3D "mesh" of the data.


% 5. Continue with the 3x2 subplot, but plot in the top right corner.


% 6. Now use the same outputs as before and the surf() function to create a
%    3D "surface" of the data.


% 5. Continue with the 3x2 subplot, but plot in the middle left.


% 7. Use the sphere() function to create the new x, y, and z data for a 
%    sphere consisting of 50 data points, of radius 5.
%    [D, E, F]





% 8. Use the sphere outputs to make a 3D "surface" of the sphere.


% 9. Continue with the 3x2 subplot, but plot in the middle right.


% 10. Use the cylinder() function to create the new x, y, and z data for a 
%     cylinder of 50 data points using the given variable r1 
%     (which contains a vector of radii).
%     [G, H, I]


% 11. Use the cylinder outputs to make a 3D "surface" of the cylinder.


% 12. Continue with the 3x2 subplot, but plot in the bottom left corner.


% 13. Use the sphere function make a flat disk consisting of 50 data 
%     points, of radius 1.
%     [J, K, L]



% 14. Use the disk outputs to make a 3D "surface" of the disk.


% 15. Continue with the 3x2 subplot, but plot in the bottom right corner.


% 16. Use the data for the cylinder you made in part 10 and the disk you 
%     made in part 13 to make a 3D "surface" of a closed cylinder.
