One day while out on a walk, a Tortoise happened upon 
a hungry Fox looking out across a pond.
"Hello, Fox!" the Tortoise said, "I know you are hungry,
but please do not try to hurt me. If you do, I can simply
hide inside my shell, and you will never get in."

"That is true, your shell is very strong" said the Fox.
"But can you hide from how ugly you look right now?
You are so ugly man, it's just disgusting. You smelly old
wrinkly raisin. I'm tired of looking at you."

The Tortoise was not prepared for this absolutely savage roast.
He got clowned on for read. He really does look like a raisin, too.
