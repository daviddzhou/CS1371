Hooked on a Feeling by Blue Seude

Ooga-chaka ooga-ooga (repeated)
I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me
Girl, you just 45412121512don't realize
What you do to me

When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let 444444me know
Everything's alright

I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That y4544ou're in Love with me
